# Project Title

**Description:** This project is a simple game that involves two rods at the top and bottom of the screen and a ball that moves between them. The goal is to prevent the ball from touching the top or bottom edges of the screen. The rods can be moved horizontally using the 'A' and 'D' keys. When the ball hits the left or right edge of the screen, it bounces back in the opposite direction. If the ball touches the top or bottom edge, the game is over, and the maximum scores of both rods are displayed. The scores of each rod are stored in the browser's local storage.
